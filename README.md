# MRI Safety Thesis: Translational Force Assessment of Retained Epicardial Leads

This repository contains the ongoing LaTeX-based thesis work for a Master‚Äôs degree in Medical Physics. The research aims to develop and validate a method to assess MRI-induced translational forces on retained epicardial leads using a custom-built solenoid and pendulum test rig.

## üß™ Research Focus

**Objective**:  
To experimentally determine the translational forces acting on retained epicardial leads in an MRI environment and propose a standardized measurement approach.

**Core Elements**:
- Solenoid-based field simulation
- 3D-printed pendulum apparatus
- High-resolution displacement tracking
- Field strength variation and correlation to force
- ASTM and AAPM standard references

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compiling the Thesis

You‚Äôll need a full LaTeX environment (TeX Live recommended) with these packages: `graphicx`, `pdfpages`, `xcolor`, `amsmath`, `siunitx`, `biblatex`, etc.

**To compile:**

```bash
latexmk -pdf main.tex
```

or manually:

```bash
pdflatex main.tex
bibtex main
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex
```

This is a work in progress. The layout and content may shift as the research develops. Contributions or feedback welcome via GitHub Issues.
