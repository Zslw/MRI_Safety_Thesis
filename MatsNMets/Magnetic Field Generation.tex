\subsection*{Magnetic Field Generation}

Magnetic fields were generated using a \textbf{custom-built air-core solenoid}, approximately 15 cm in length and 10 cm in outer diameter. The solenoid was densely wound with \textbf{copper wire ($\sim$1 mm diameter)}, forming an inner core of approximately 5 cm. A \textbf{Pasco Scientific SF-9584 DC power supply} was used to deliver currents in the range of \textbf{0--4 A}, corresponding to magnetic field strengths from \textbf{1 to 18.9 Gauss}. The system operated in a continuous mode; no rest periods were applied between trials due to the time required to stabilize the pendulum after each adjustment. Figure \ref{labsetup} shows the experimental lab setup used to assess the methodology accuracy and reliability with all used components.

\subsection{Magnetic Field and Gradient Mapping Platform}

Magnetic field strength ($B_0$) and gradient ($\nabla B_0$) measurements were performed using a commercial Hall-effect Gaussmeter (Model GM2, AlphaLab Inc., Salt Lake City, UT).  The GM2 operates on the Hall effect principle, wherein a voltage is generated across a probe when exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field. This voltage is proportional to the local magnetic flux density, enabling precise spot measurements of field magnitude. The Gaussmeter used has an accuracy of 1\% of the DC reading in the 16$^\circ$C to 29$^\circ$C range.

To ensure spatial accuracy and reproducibility, a fixture made from rigid \gls{pvc} was constructed by previous Creighton University students \cite{haddixProposal}. The platform comprises a 300 mm square base and a 280 mm diameter vertical circular plate, perforated with a 5x5 grid of probe-access holes spaced at 20 mm intervals as shown in figure \ref{fig:fieldmapping}. Each access point was numerically indexed to facilitate 2D field mapping in the X-Y plane.

In clinical use, the entire fixture is intended to be shifted axially along the Z-direction of a horizontal bore MRI scanner using controlled couch increments (e.g., 10 cm). This translation allows for volumetric sampling of $B_0$ over several planes. The spatial magnetic field gradient$\nabla B_0$ can then be estimated numerically using finite difference calculations between adjacent measurement points. This method has previously been applied to MRI mapping in the work by Ferreira \cite{ferreira2017}.
