Unless you substantially alter a figure, you are not allowed to use figures from a published document, including journal articles, without copyright permission from the publisher.  This is usually easily secured, without cost to you.  Go to the journal article or book on the publisher's website, and find the Copyrights/Permissions link.  Just fill out the form or follow instructions, and you will be emailed documentation of permission to use the figure in your thesis.  For more information on using copyrighted figures in your thesis, see 

\href{http://guides.lib.umich.edu/dissertationcopyright/otherscontent}{http://guides.lib.umich.edu/dissertationcopyright/otherscontent}.

You can include the copyright permissions in an appendix as figures or include a pdf using this command \verb!\includepdf[scale=0.9]{rsna.pdf}!. If you do this, you could reference the appendix in each figure caption with ``(See Appendix B for documentation of permission to republish from [cite source].)" Alternatively, you can save your permission documents into a separate document and include them as a separate upload to the \gls{cdr}.  Make sure you note in your thesis that you are using the figure with permission.  Please talk to Richard Jizba at the Creighton Library for advice.
