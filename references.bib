	abstract = { Epicardial pacing wires retained in patients who undergo cardiac surgery are thought to be a relative contraindication to MR imaging. However, to our knowledge no published evidence supports this belief. Because other metallic materials retained after cardiac surgery might represent a hazard to patients who undergo MR imaging, we sought to determine the safety of such imaging.We examined 200 patients who underwent MR imaging at 1 or 1.5 T after cardiac surgery. Eighty-one were examined with ECG monitoring. The presence of temporary epicardial pacing wires, prosthetic valves, and other metal materials was confirmed by chest radiography.Of the 200 patients reviewed, all had postoperative metallic material visible on chest radiographs. Temporary epicardial pacing wire, cut short at the skin, was seen in 51 patients. Of the 81 patients examined with ECG monitoring, we found that MR imaging produced no changes from baseline ECG rhythms. None of the 200 patients reported symptoms suggesting arrhythmia or other cardiac dysfunction during MR imaging.MR imaging can be performed safely in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery and have retained metallic material, including valve replacements and temporary epicardial pacing wires cut short at the skin. MR imaging of patients with pacemakers was not evaluated, and we recommend that pacemakers remain a contraindication to MR imaging. },

@article{Mubarak:2023aa,
	abstract = {Pacing wires are commonly used during cardiac surgery to monitor heart rhythm and, if necessary, provide temporary pacing. These wires are usually removed a few days after surgery, but the procedure has been associated with complications. The purpose of this study was to summarize the literature on complications related to pacing wire removal after cardiac surgery. A systematic review was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Articles from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2022, were considered. The literature was then registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42023418165). PROSPERO is the first database to record systematic reviews in health, and it promotes best practices around the world through broad consultation to eliminate redundancy and waste of time and money. Following that, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was used to screen the data. PRISMA consists of a four-stage flow diagram and a "checklist" of 27 elements necessary for the rigorous and transparent dissemination of the systematic review's techniques and conclusions. These methods were used to ensure the integrity of the systematic review. The systematic review included six studies with a total of 18,453 patients. The most common pacing wire removal complications were retention of the wire (0.56%), arrhythmia (0.67%), delayed discharge due to delayed wire removal (0.41%), and cardiac tamponade (0.1%). The overall complication rate was 1.74%. A subgroup analysis revealed that earlier removal (within 48-72 hours of surgery) was associated with a higher incidence of bleeding, whereas later removal (after 72 hours) was associated with a higher incidence of delayed discharge. Pacing wire removal following cardiac surgery is associated with many complications, including retention of wire, arrhythmia, delayed discharge, tamponade, and death. These complications are more likely to occur with earlier or later removal of the pacing wires. Although the complication rate was lower, clinicians should be aware of these risks and take appropriate precautions when scheduling pacing wire removal. More research is needed to determine the necessity of pacing wires in cardiac surgery.},
